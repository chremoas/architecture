# Blueprint Calculator

_(IN PROGRESS)_

The Blueprint Calculator is a set of services and ui's that will allow anonymous users to calculate blueprints off of current market prices.  It will also utilize other pieces of this ecosystem for logged in users such as the warehouse, market, shipping, etc (anything that makes sense at least).
