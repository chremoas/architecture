# Industry Services Documentation

_(IN PROGRESS)_

Consider this page an index into the things that live beneath it.  These things might be very large things which are composed of many smaller things or they may be fairly large things in their own right.

[blueprint-calculator](blueprint-calculator/README.me)

The blueprint calculator will be a publicly accessible component very much akin to Fuzzy Steve's calculator.  My goal is not to compete with him but rather to provide my own that has extra bells and whistles if you're logged in ;).

[catalog](catalog/README.md)

The catalog service is a simple representation of what is available within an organizations 'warehouses'

[shipping](shipping/README.md)

Shipping represents the act of move bits and bobs around throughout the supply chain.

[warehouse](warehouse/README.md)

The warehouse is a concept I'm stealing from [eve-cost.eu](http://www.eve-cost.eu).  At it's core, it is your entities assets but really only those that you give a damn about throughout your supply chain.  It manages a tiny bit of data above and beyond what you might find in the eve xml assets API endpoint though.
